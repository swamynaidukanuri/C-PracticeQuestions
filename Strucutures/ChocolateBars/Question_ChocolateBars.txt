Define a structure Chocolate with 3 attributes:
Type (white, dark, milk)
Weight
Price

Write a program that asks user how many chocolate bars (struct Chocolate) we want,
read the data into a variable and create a Array of Chocolates with that user input.

Write 2 functions:
* One that fills the array with values (from user)
* function that finds the most expansive chocolate bar and its index and “return” them both to main ,hint:(you need another struct here)
  The most expansive chocolate bar is the one with maximum price-quantity-ratio
