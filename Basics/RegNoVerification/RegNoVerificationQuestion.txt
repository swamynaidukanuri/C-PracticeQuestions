Write a simple program that asks the user for a Car registration number and then verifies that by:
• Using a length function to make sure 6 characters were entered, use cout for displaying 
error if user enters less or more letters. 
• Check the first three character to make sure they are alphabetic. You can use 
the isalpha(char) function for this.
• Check the last three character to make sure they are numeric. You can use 
the isdigit(char) function for this.
• Include “ctype.h” for both isalpha() and isdigit() functions
